# esprit-board

This repository contains the schematics, BOM, Gerber files, and Proteus project for a ESP32-based board capaple of running ClojureScript. These boards are designed to be used with the [Esprit REPL](https://github.com/mfikes/esprit).

> Note: You don't need to use this particilar board to run ClojureScript. Any ESP32 WROVER with 8Â MiB SPIRAM is capable of running a ClojureScript REPL. 

The files in this repository are open source. Feel free to use them to understand how things work, use the Gerbers and BOM make your own boards, etc.

If you'd like to buy one pre-assembled they are [available on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/fikesfarm/esprit-clojurescript-repl/).
